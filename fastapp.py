Transcript: if you want to learn the ins and outs of\nhow to make content that attracts the\nperfect person into your ecosystem\nwhether that's for your business for\nyour product or for just your creative\nprocess we're gonna dive deep with\nChristo on The Fifth Element of his\nbusiness psychology series attraction\nmarketing you want to stick around for\nthat so let's just jump right into it\nChris when you say attraction marketing\nwhat exactly do you mean what is it for\nme attraction marketing is this thing\nthat lives between a couple different\nprinciples that you may be aware of one\nis direct Outreach and sales which is\nhow you do outbound sales strategies and\nsomething that's much more ambient which\nis content marketing which is where you\ncreate lots of content and over a long\nperiod of time it tracks the right kinds\nof clients too ideally this is what I\nwould recommend to every single person\nto build your personal brand new thought\nleadership your Authority but people\ndon't have that kind of Runway so they\nneed more tangible results so they can't\nafford to do this for three five seven\nyears so this is some hybrid approach\nthat lives in between more outbound\nreach and sales approach versus more\nambient content marketing personal brand\nbuilding when we talk about sales and\nOutreach what are the classic kind of\nbehaviors that you have to do to ensure\nthat you get that kind of result short\nof cold calling people or cold emailing\nor cold messaging people the next\nversion of that is something like this\nand you see this framework being used by\na lot of people I do this I help clients\nwith this and if you need help with this\ntalk to me now so it's very clear very\ntransactional it's hyper focused we\nspoke to Richard Moore recently on\nLinkedIn on a live LinkedIn audio\nconversation he teaches people how to do\nsales using LinkedIn period and the\npremise was how to go from creating\ncontent to getting customers and he's\nlike most of what I do teaches\nprinciples around direct sales via\nsocial media more specifically on\nLinkedIn very rarely are you going to\nsee a piece from him about a personal\nstory something emotional that he's\ngoing through because he just wants\npeople to know and Associate him with\nthe idea of direct sales strategies\nusing LinkedIn specifically so even\nwhile he's making content which we could\nargue is the inbound marketing that that\nyou said he is using direct sales\npractices in that content so as soon as\nyou visit his page you're like I know\nwhat this man does I know what he sells\nand either I'm interested or not am I\nunderstanding that correctly yeah and\nit's not even on on his page it's really\nif you're on LinkedIn one of the\nstrategies he talks about is if anyone\nis looking at his profile it's a prompt\nfor him to reach out so he's constantly\nlook at who is looking at his profile\nand saying hey I noticed you're looking\nat my profile is there anything you need\nhelp with and you know this is a very\neffective sales strategy by the way so\nif you don't know this you can use the\nbasic LinkedIn function or pay for the\nmore premium version which allows you to\nsee more of who is looking at you and\nwhat they're doing this is the premise\nthat Richard works with which is no\none's going to look at your profile\npicture unless they saw something that\nyou did either as a comment to another\npost or something that you posted and\nthen trying to figure out who you are\nit's not by random chance it's not like\nwe're scrolling through profiles\nrandomly on LinkedIn so the minute\nsomebody touches it it means that for\nsome reason they're curious they're\ninterested and they want to see who the\nheck you are it's a great great way for\nyou to turn a lukewarm Person of\nInterest to something that's much warmer\nand then on the other side of this coin\nis what you called content marketing\nspecifically and you said it was a long\ngame help me understand the difference\nbecause there was a little bit of\ncontent Marketing in that Richard Moore\nexample so how is content marketing\ndifferent than sales and Outreach that\nis more outbound based this is more of\nan inbound strategy which is more of\nwhat I do and what many content creators\nor designer creative types do which is\nwe create stuff sometimes it's visual\nsometimes it's us demonstrating what it\nis that we do for example if I like to\ndraw James Barn likes to draw so he does\nthis and he draws logos and he makes\nfunny videos sometimes he dances in them\nand it just lets people know about what\nit is that we're doing there's no call\nto action there's no hard sale there's\nnot even a soft sale and in presenting\nhis work over time you may gain\nfollowers and some of those followers\nmight be people who want to buy a logo\nfrom him and so then the onus is on them\nto reach out to James saying hey I love\nwhat you do how much is it and I'll give\nyou an example this is real life example\nright now I was going through my\nInstagram feed and I'm looking at this\ntypographic animation thing and\nInstagram knows that I like topography\ndesign and animation and I see this\nthing and it's pretty cool it's an\nanimated typographic poster on a\nbusboard or something and then it's a\ntutorial on how to create this effect\nusing gradients in After Effects I\ninstantly follow this person and I reach\nout in their DMs I say hey how much does\nit cost to make that thing for something\nI'm looking at this person gave me a\nprice he said three thousand dollars\nthree to four thousand dollars I said\nthe most I have is three K's is\nsomething we can do and he's like yes he\nsaid we'll send me a proposal let's go\nhe wasn't looking for me as a client per\nse but by demonstrating what he does his\nexpertise is Art his skill his\npersonality he's able to attract people\nto you there's no direct correlation\nbetween that pose and me seeing it me\nreaching out I want to just share for\nthe audience the key distinction here is\nif you are doing sales Outreach\nbehaviors you are inquiring to the end\nconsumer you are going to The Client\nFirst when you're doing content\nmarketing if you were strictly doing it\nbecause Chris mentioned earlier there's\na hybrid approach the audience is\ninquiring because of all the Goodwill\nthat you've put out there talk to me\nabout what the hybrid approach would\nlook like because like you said earlier\nnot everybody has the bandwidth or the\nrunway to sit there and just make\ncontent without ever asking so what\nwould the hybrid approach look like\nbetween these two if they were to\ncoexist I think that's what we're going\nto talk about in terms of what we're\nplanning on doing for the workshop\nbecause I realize people don't have the\nluxury of creating content for the sake\nof creating content or perhaps they're\ncreating content with a poor strategy to\nbegin with so you could create content\nfor 100 years and get zero zero\ninquiries for new work we want to fix\nthat I'm a big believer in building\nthought leadership and building up your\npersonal brand and I'll tell you\nphilosophically where Richard and I\ndisagree and I want to present this so\nthat each person can determine where\nthey live on the Spectrum if you look at\nour YouTube channel presumably this is\nwhere everybody's watching we've created\nover 1800 videos that's a lot of\nfreaking videos in most of the videos we\ndon't ask for anything we're not trying\nto get you to sign up for anything and\nyou feel the genuine nature of our\ngenerosity and we build a relationship\nwith you Richard's approach is I'm\nlooking for a client I'm looking at the\nactions that I take that lead to result\nthat I want his whole thing is like I'm\nhere to optimize my work day to generate\nmoney or clients for my business so when\nyou do a very targeted approach like\nthis I'm looking for clients you're\ngoing to be more successful at hitting\nthose clients and when you're taking a\nbroader approach like myself like I'm\ngoing to broadcast content out there\nbecause I think I have a idea of who you\nare and what your struggles are I'm\ngoing to hit you I'm gonna hit three of\nyour friends and people I didn't even\nknow I was gonna hit because it's not as\ntargeted so in the short term if we're\nto bet who is going to win this race\nyou're going to put all your money on\nRichard I would too because he's going\nto make more money in the short term but\nif we step back and say who's going to\nmake more money we should be more\nvaluable who's going to be a key person\nof influence three five 15 25 years from\nnow it's not so clear of an answer\nbecause what we've done is we've built\nCommunity we've created value and the\nthing that you mentioned before is we've\ncreated a lot of good will and when you\ncreate good will people give you the\nbenefit the doubt they're willing to\nbecome I prefer lack of a better term a\nSuper Fan they're on the road to\nbecoming a Super Fan where they'll\nsupport you in everything that you do\nwhether you drop a t-shirt a poster\nwhere you show up to speak at an event\nthey'll go out and they'll buy tickets\nbecause they feel a personal connection\nto you so one model is more\ntransactional I do something if you need\nhelp with this thing I will provide this\nto you in exchange for your money my\nmodel is more transformational it's not\ntransactional I will not see money in a\ndirect correlation between my efforts\nand what someone gives me on a\none-to-one relationship but I believe\nwhat I'm doing is building value here's\nwhere it gets real interesting people\nlike Conor McGregor Kylie Jenner The\nRock have built up a lifetime of either\ncontent or Goodwill or relation with\nsomeone and then where they cash in is\nThe Rock has a Kila line which is worth\na couple hundred million dollars same\nthing with Conor McGregor proper fifth\nIrish whiskey so they've been doing\nsomething we get to know them we get to\nlike and trust them and eventually when\nthey ask for something you're willing to\nbuy and they're worth so much more I\nfeel like you may have heard him say the\nword Workshop up he'll be going into a\ndeep dive explanation of all of this\nacross the European tour which will\nstart in April so if you are interested\nin doing something like that and you've\nenjoyed these five video series that is\nsomething that I would highly encourage\nyou to look in the description on before\nwe go into the hybrid approach Chris the\nway I understood that is the first one\nis a strictly sales approach hence the\ntransaction the next one is a brand\napproach to where at any point once\nyou've given so much Goodwill you could\ntechnically sell anything if it aligns\nwith your brand because the audience\ntrusts your brand and the things that\nyou deem worthy of buying my question is\nwhat are the things that someone needs\nto consider when they decide which camp\nthey're in and how they navigate their\nmarketing and I want to be clear that\nyou don't have to pick one or the other\nyou could do both you can actually\ncreate content that's actually\ntransactional and create longer term\ncontent that's transformational but you\nstart to muddy up the waters a little\nbit because sometimes you're selling and\nsometimes you're not and I guess we do\nsome version of that if you are in need\nof money like you can't eat you can't\npay rent you owe money for taxes your\npartner is going to leave you your\nchildren earn Rags you need to focus on\nbuilding a business and needing a sale\nyou don't have the luxury of the runway\nthat it's going to take to build\nGoodwill up with your community your\naudience and potentially some of your\ncustomers you got to take care of your\nbusiness first get your house in order\nso in that case I'm going to recommend\nthat you go for more direct sales\napproach more outbound versus an inbound\nstrategy what are some other things for\nthem to decipher if they should go the\ninbound route aside from they don't need\nmoney right now once you have your basic\nneeds taken care of we're not talking\nabout living a life of luxury and having\nfancy sports cars but you have money for\nrent for food you can go out on a date\nyou have a little nest egg in case bad\nthings happen your rainy day fun you're\ngood so really what you want to do now\nyou have to think about where do I want\nto be three five ten years from now and\nyou move into Authority building so this\nusually is chronological like in terms\nof how this usually develops but not\nalways is you've got some training\nwhether it's self-taught or you've\nlearned it in a university you're a\npractitioner the thing that you learn\nyou've been able to do that for a period\nof time and you might have branched off\non your own at this point so we're not\ntalking about someone who's 14 years old\ntrying to build Authority that's a\nlittle bit ridiculous so you're maybe in\nyour mid-20s your late 20s early 30s\nsomewhere in there where you start to\nthink about well what's my future like\nI'm not always going to want to chase\nclients the way that I do and it's not\nlong-term sustainable so this is now\nyou're in the place where I have things\nI've learned things that I can share\ninside I have documentation I have proof\nof the things I've been able to do it's\na good time to start to share that and\nthe way that I would do it is I would\nstart to share that with the younger\nversion of yourself and that's a great\nway to frame it so we're not thinking\nabout clients we're not thinking about\nour competitors we're just saying what\nwould the younger version of myself want\nto know needs to know that could save\nthem a lot of heartache and pain so you\nstart to distill those life lessons down\nit could be resources whatever it is\nyou're going to speak to this person the\nreason why I say your younger self is\nbecause you know this person already you\nknow their habits you know their\nresistance you know the way they think\nabout learning sometimes we have a\ndifficult time in writing and creating\ncontent because we don't have a clear\npictures who the person yeah well this\nperson you know because you spent the\nmost time of your life with this person\nit's you maybe you could talk about a\nmentor or a teacher they have yet to\nmeet and what you're learning from this\nperson and you can send it down that\ntimeline if you will and here's the cool\npart there is some younger version of\nyou out there that is not named you and\nif it's a big enough audience they'll\nshow up for you and they'll get really\nexcited and they're gonna get pumped up\nthey like your style your tone your\ndelivery your experience your aesthetic\nand they're going to be hungry for the\nkind of content that you create I'm so\nglad that you answered that question the\nway that you did because I personally\nstruggled in the early stages and only\nleaning on brand and never asking when I\nwasn't in a position to only lean on\nbrand and the reason why I asked you\nthat question is because there's a\nlistener out there right now who whether\nyou want to deem it fortunately\nunfortunately because I love this person\nas well garyvee who says just give value\njust give give give give never ask even\nthough he says ask it the third time but\nit's never really clear when I should\nask and then that person who's listening\nscapegoats Their Fear of selling or\ntheir lack of wanting to ask something\nwith well I'm just building my brand you\nneed money you need to build your\nbusiness you need to make income it's\nnot a bad thing for you to be\ntransactional when you need to survive\nand you are also giving value to the\nother person because then if you're only\ngiving value and never getting anything\nwhen you actually need something I think\nChris and correct me if I'm wrong you\ncan start to feel that that\ndisingenuousness when you're like\nbuilding a brand but you also want to\ntransact and then it just breeds\nresentment in the person who's doing\nthat there's a lot that you said there\nbut the part I'm going to zero in on is\nthis part some people mistakenly mix\nthese two strategies they think one they\nexecute like the other give you an\nexample you really want sales your\ntransactional and you're starving but\nyou're playing the long content game but\nyou actually don't behave like that so\nyou're actually not giving value it's a\nthinly veiled disguise and most people\ncan see right through it yes and I think\nit's better that you recognize who you\nare where you're at in your life and be\nsuper clear and transparent because\nyou're not fooling anybody you and I\nfollow people and maybe some of them\noverlap where all they seem to be doing\nis selling to you all the time and if\nyou need that service if you want that\npiece of information you're gonna\nsupport it you're gonna say I want to\nreach out to you let's let's do work I'm\ngoing to keep following you oftentimes\nespecially I find it with myself that\nyou want to sell and I'm not here to buy\nanything so I'm gonna unfollow you I'm\ngonna tune you out for a while I'll\ncheck in with you in three six nine\nmonths but from this point forward I'm\ngonna tune you out and that's the danger\nof wanting to sell to people all the\ntime it's hard to argue against the\nperson who's selling all the time when\nthey're putting a whole lot of money\naway you're like okay I get it I just\nhave a different relationship with you\nso let's talk about this model that\nyou've been exploring which we've deemed\nthe hybrid approach where do these two\nworlds coexist in your in your thinking\nnumber one it starts with creating\nsomething that's valuable to someone it\nstarts really there and we say like\ncreate high value content like what does\nthat even mean well teach me something I\ndidn't know that I haven't already seen\na thousand times or share something I\nknow but in a way that I've never seen\nor deliver in a way that I think is\nfunny interesting here's the example\nthere's a guy who's like hip-hop history\nI believe where he speaks in language of\nlike yo that cat said this girl or he\nbreaks down movies or plays that are\njust like pieces of literature that are\njust hard for the everyday person to\nunderstand because the language is funky\nas heck they're using some like Old\nEnglish you know and so he takes this\nhe's a he's a African-American and he\ntalks about it I'm like this is super\nentertaining he's really letting you\nunderstand so he's taking a story but\nhe's presenting it to us in a way that's\nnew and novel and different there's a\nsimilar concept too it's like drunken\nhistory and these are experts and so\nthey loosen up because they're having\nLibations and they're like oh okay so\nit's like this and then again to\narguments it's kind of funny to watch so\nfirst spend the time to identify a\nresource a tool a guide a study that you\nproduce and package it package in your\nvoice your tone the colors and logos of\nyour company whatever it is that you do\nand package it up and that's how you can\ndetermine if it's a high value piece of\ncontent what is the market rate for this\npiece like what would somebody literally\npay to know and if you could say zero\nthen that is worth zero so your target\nis something about 30 a hundred dollars\nworth of value that's good enough and\nsome people might then underestimate and\nsay well nothing I do is ever valuable\nwell that's not over correct here we\njust want to have an honest conversation\nif you were to ask a neutral friend to\nlook at this thing and say would you pay\nmoney for this and how much would you\npay and they gave you an honest answer\nthen you know okay so I spent a month\nand a half designing figuring out\nsomething let's just say whatever it is\nand now I want to share that with people\nbecause it's going to help them it's\ngoing to make their life easier it's\ngoing to get them closer to their goals\nnow I'm not going to just upload a PDF\nand say download the whole thing I want\nto build a little Rapport and I want to\nuse social channels to my benefit so\nwhat I'll do is I'll extract some of the\nhigh value nuggets from this guy this\nstudy this report whatever it is I'm\ngonna write a post about it and I'm\ngonna say something like for example if\nyou write email copy and you're doing\ndirect sales via email you figured out\nthe 100 subject lines that have the\nhighest open rates and you've run 10 000\ncampaigns so you have some evidence\nremember that part about you're in this\nplace in your life where you've done\nstuff you have proof and evidence okay\nyou can then jump on a platform like\nLinkedIn and say here are are three\nsubject lines that are guaranteed to\noutperform anything that you're writing\nand you would give it to them and you\nwould explain why so you're adding a\nlittle more meat on the bones and then\nyou would say something like I've\nactually just finished writing the top\n100 highest performing subject lines\nover a four year period ten thousand\ndifferent campaigns tested I'm gonna\ngive it to you for free no strings\nattached just comment this word below so\nI know who to give it to so this is the\nhybrid approach this is also Richard's\napproach by the way so now I've got\nsomething valuable I've created interest\nthe way that you've written it is just\nsuper enticing and there's value already\ndelivered to this and so naturally\npeople are very curious like wow these\ntwo are so good what did the other 97\nlook like I want the rest and so now\nwhat you've done is you've asked the\naudience to self-identify I'm a person\nwho writes emails and I'm looking for\nclients and I need to know what subject\nlines work if somebody's not interested\nin that they're not going to read your\nposts they're not going to engage with\nyou they're definitely not going to\ncomment below whatever the magic phrase\nis now they've identified and now\nthey're giving you permission to reach\nout to them quite literally they're\nsaying yo I want the rest of this please\nso you can say something like hey I just\nwanted to provide this resource to you\nthank you for downloading it I'm curious\nis there a problem that you're trying to\nsolve it doesn't have to be much more\ncomplicated than that or out of Interest\nwas there anything that caught your eye\nwhat part stood out for you and if it\nfeels like they're aligned with their\nproblem what you can do then you should\nescalate and you should ask for the next\nthing and the next thing you're going to\nask for is I have three time slots\navailable next week where I spend 25\nminutes helping people just like you\ndiagnose their email campaigns it's just\nof interest to you so you're asking them\nto make very small commitments where\neach time they engage you're going to\ngive them increasing amounts of value\nthis is the classic classic structure of\npermission marketing by Seth Godin so\nwhat we're doing in this Modern Age of\nsocial media is we're asking for people\nto volunteer to enroll in a long-term\nmarketing campaign where with each\ninteraction that we go deeper we get\nincreasing amounts of value so first\npiece of value is here are the three\nhighest performing subject line for\nemail campaigns here is the 97 remaining\npieces of value in terms of highest\nperforming subject lines for email\ncampaign and now I would love to give\nyou a diagnostic that's free to you to\nlook at what you're doing to discuss\nwhat your goals and challenges are to\nsee if I might be able to solve them\nthen if they agree to that Zoom call or\nwhatever meeting then now you can sit\nthere and diagnose provide more value\nand at this point you can then tell them\nat the end of this I'm going to tell you\nabout a way that we can work together\nonly if it feels right to you so you're\ntelling them this is a sales call but\nnot I'm not going to apply any high\npressure thing to you I'm just going to\npark it at the end only if you're\ninterested and then that prospects I I\nthink we need your help what's the plan\nlook like and that's how you go from\nstrangers to friends and friends to\ncustomers that's the process that's\nattraction marketing so if someone were\nto like yo the hybrid approach I love it\nI want to do it what should be their\nfirst course of action on the thing that\nthey get right before they're like okay\nI need a I need a free sample I need a\nfunnel I need to be able to convert in\nthe DMs like what do they need to get\nright first we'll get clear on your\naudience who is it that you're marketing\nto do they have an urgent desire to\nsolve a very uncomfortable pain point do\nthey have the means to be able to buy a\nsolution to them they don't have the\nmeans it's not any good so you can solve\na problem for someone but they can't\nafford the solution it's not going to\nreally work so for example if somebody\nis in like a lower income bracket and\nneeds to go from point A to point B to\ngo to work but they're on a place where\nthey have great credit or they have a\ndown payment or they're even\ncontemplating buying a car they don't\nreally care how sophisticated your\nfunnel your marketing campaign is they\njust can't buy a car really what you\nshould do is be solving other kinds of\ntransportation problems for them maybe a\nmonth-long pass that allows them to take\nany form of public transportation you\nshould be focused on that or what many\nindustrial designers and urban planning\npeople are trying to figure out is\nsomething called The Last Mile so we can\ntake public transportation but it's that\nlast mile that kills us where we have to\nwalk somewhere to work or park to a\nrestaurant so they make electric\nscooters they make all kinds of devices\nto get you past that Last Mile and\nthat's what they're focused on because\nwe're not going to inherently change the\ninfrastructure of public transportation\nbut we can make easier for you from the\nstop in which you get off at to where\nyou need to be so that's where they need\nto focus their energy the energy that\nyou need to focus for the hybrid\napproach of Attraction marketing to work\nis watch the last four videos so you can\ndial in your attraction marketing for it\nto be effective I do have one last\nquestion and then I'll leave you to take\nit wherever you want to take it what do\nyou think people get wrong when trying\nto execute this hybrid approach that you\nare seeing often and you think people\nshould avoid making this mistake I don't\nsee so many people taking the hybrid\napproach we know many people on the one\nside of the spectrum or the other where\nthey're really about building\nquote-unquote brand or they're just\ndoing all sales all the time we don't\nsee a lot of sophisticated things in the\nmiddle because the thing in the middle\nis very difficult because not only do\nyou have to understand how to do direct\nsales but you also have to know how to\nmake content that attracts people to you\nthat's a fact that it's going to be\nvaluable so they're going to be\ninherently fewer people could do that\nbecause a they're not aware and B it's\nnot easy so I don't really have an easy\nanswer for you there no I think think\nthat answer was sufficient it is\nprobably still not as long of a game as\nstrictly building brand when you need\nmoney but it is a sophisticated game\nthat will be challenging at first but\nwhen you can Master it the upside is\ncrazy I mean look at Chris maybe the\nword is not master but you have done an\nexceptional job in doing that okay gang\nthat is the end of the five part series\nof the five core Essentials to grow your\nbusiness as a creative freelancer if\nyou've enjoyed this series you can go\nback to the last four videos binge them\nas many times as you want ask questions\nin the comments but I did want to leave\nsome time at the end of this video if\nyou've gotten value and are still here\nwith us for Chris to just say a few\nwords about the European tour that's\ncoming up for him to teach these\nprinciples very very in-depth and for\nyou to get as much value as possible so\nif you're still here check that out and\nwe'll see you in the next video well\nfirst of all I want to say thank you\nthanks for making all the way to end we\nknow there's a high drop off rate and\nthe fact that you're still here says a\nlot to me about who you are and that\nyou're connecting to the content what a\nlot of people don't realize about me\nwhere I came from is before I made a\nYouTube video I taught at private art\nschools for 15 years before I taught at\na private art school I ran a business\nfor even longer period of time so I was\nrunning a successful motion design\nbusiness for five years prior to even\nthinking about teaching what I've come\nto realize about myself is my identity I\nthought was for a very long time a\nservice provider one who makes\ncommercials graphic design visual things\nfor people but I was suppressing a\ndeeper identity which was one of an\neducator so when people used to ask me\nwho are you Chris I'm a designer I'm a\ndesigner I would say that everywhere I\nwould go I took great pride in that but\ntoday when people ask me what are you\nwhat do you do I don't pause so much\nanymore I just say I'm a teacher that's\nconnected to who I am over the last two\nand a half years it's been very\ndifficult not on us but on every single\nperson on the planet because of covid\nand recently when I went out and I was\nteaching again in person I kind of\nreignited a passion inside of me that\nmade me feel so alive and so when I was\nin doing a tour a workshop tour in\nAustralia I felt more alive than I've\nbeen in a long time you hear me say\nthings like my brain was on fire and I\nlive to grow so when I'm out there\nteaching there was a quote here I was\ninterviewed recently and I was like I\nreally like this here we go Craig Philip\ntold me this he's like you teach for\nyourself that you practice for your\nstudents I say to them I think there's\nthis dichotomy with teaching that it's\nsimultaneously a selfish act and an act\nof generosity so when I teach I'm\nsharing my goods if you will to to the\npeople or the person is in front of me\nright I'm sharing it with you like here\nare tools here's our ideas here's a big\nreframe or here's how you would phrase\nthis so that you have to deal with this\nfriction Point anymore but in doing so\nwhat the person who's asking the\nquestion is unaware of this they're\nextracting or inducing something from me\nwhich is a piece of information I didn't\neven know I had and in doing so I\nlearned something about myself and when\nyou're I slide up I'm like wow okay I\nhave another way of explaining that to\nyou and here's the cool part of like\nlive teaching which is one person will\nsay something and they accept your\nanswer but another person's like uh wait\na minute I don't accept it how about\nthis Chris how about this how about this\nand you're getting hit from three\ndifferent angles so you'll have a much\nclearer picture as to what's not working\nso you explain it slightly different\nways or in a whole different way it's a\nvery long way of saying something so I\nfeel most alive when I'm teaching people\nin person and so we decided to try a\nconcept we're not an event production\ncompany but if I was really filled with\njoy and delight and my creative Soul was\nfulfilled in Australia why wouldn't we\ntry this more often in more places so\nwe're like let's go to Europe let's run\nsome workshops and I don't want these\nartificial time constraints to be put on\nus I want to do a full eight hours of\nteaching on two different subjects\nversus smashing everything I know\ntogether in four hours or even 30\nminutes so we're trying a theory we're\ngonna go to Europe we're gonna be there\nin April and we're gonna hit seven\ndifferent cities tickets are selling out\nreally fast now so we're gonna probably\nannounce that we're sold out in London\nand Berlin pretty soon because I keep\nseeing a steady stream of tickets I hope\nto be able to see you there I feel deep\ninside my heart that if you're willing\nto show up and put in your best effort\nwell I teach you will be\ntransformational there's the transaction\nthat's happening you have to buy a\nticket but the transformation that you\nreceive will far exceed the mountain you\npay so we'll see you in Europe is that\nright ciao\nall right
